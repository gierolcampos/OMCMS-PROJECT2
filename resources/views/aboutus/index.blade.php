                                Welcome to the <b>Integrated Computer Society (ICS)</b> — the official organization for IT, IS, and computer science students, and a growing community of tech enthusiasts, innovators, and future tech leaders.
                                </p>

                                ICS was established to create a space where students can go beyond the classroom — to explore technology hands-on, collaborate with others, and grow both personally and professionally. Whether you're a first-year student just getting started, or an upperclassman looking to sharpen your skills and lead, ICS is your platform for learning, connection, and discovery.
                                </p>

From workshops and coding events to outreach projects and team-building activities, ICS helps members gain real experience, find their strengths, and become confident contributors in the field of technology.

                                We welcome students of all skill levels — beginners, self-learners, and experts alike. Here, everyone is encouraged to learn, share, lead, and grow, regardless of background or experience.
                                </p>
